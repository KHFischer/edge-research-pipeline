# Edge Research Pipeline

> ⚠️ Work in progress — APIs and modules are still evolving.

The **Edge Research Pipeline** is a modular, privacy-first research toolkit for discovering, validating, and analyzing patterns in tabular datasets. Originally built for **quantitative finance**, the pipeline’s techniques are generalizable to any domain that involves structured data and statistical rule discovery.

---

## 🚀 What This Is

A flexible Python library that lets you:

- Clean, normalize, and transform tabular data
- Engineer features with financial/statistical relevance
- Generate and label custom targets
- Discover signal candidates using rule mining and pattern search
- Run robust statistical validation tests (train/test, bootstrap, walk-forward, etc.)
- Analyze rule quality and persistence via built-in dashboards
- Reproduce results via full config export and local-only processing

---

## 🔒 Privacy by Design

All computations run **locally** — no data is ever uploaded or logged externally. Designed for regulated environments, confidential research, and reproducibility.

---

## 📦 Current Status

This repo is under **active development**. The API, structure, and features will change as we clean and extract functionality from our internal notebooks.

If you're interested in:
- Contributing to the open-source foundation
- Collaborating on use cases in finance, research, or education
- Early access to advanced features (e.g., automation, dashboard exports, academic support)

## 🔍 Use Cases

While initially focused on quantitative finance workflows — such as factor research, rule mining, and robustness testing — the pipeline can be applied to:

* Epidemiological pattern discovery
* Customer segmentation and scoring
* Educational research and reproducibility
* Industrial process optimization

If you can structure your data, you can mine edges.
